# SDP 2026 – Team 34 

This repository contains all project artifacts for our year-long capstone project.  
It is organized to clearly separate **hardware** and **software** development, while also supporting shared documentation, data, and results.

## 🛠 Usage Notes

- **docs/**  
  All project documentation, design specs, and final reports live here. Keep it updated regularly.

- **hardware/**  
  Contains circuit schematics, PCB layouts, CAD models, and firmware. If firmware grows large, it can move into `software/`.

- **software/**  
  Contains the project’s codebase, with unit tests, libraries, and scripts. Follow good coding practices and include test coverage.

- **data/** vs **results/**  
  Keep **raw data** (inputs, logs, calibration files) separate from **processed results** (plots, analysis outputs). This ensures reproducibility.

- **tools/**  
  Place any helper scripts, configuration files, or utilities used by both HW and SW here.
