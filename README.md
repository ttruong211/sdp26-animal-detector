# SDP 2026 – Team 34 

This repository contains all project artifacts for our year-long capstone project (RoadSide Animal Detector).  
It is organized to clearly separate **hardware** and **software** development, while also supporting shared documentation, data, and results.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **docs/**  
  All project documentation, design specs, and final reports live here. 

- **hardware/**  
  Contains circuit schematics, PCB layouts, CAD models, and firmware. 

- **software/**  
  Contains the project’s codebase, with unit tests, libraries, and scripts. 

- **data/** vs **results/**  
  Keep **raw data** (inputs, logs, calibration files) separate from **processed results** (plots, analysis outputs).
